#Sunsinger Alpha 

This project is an alpha demonstration of a 2D video game concept, currently titled ‘The Sunsinger’. This demonstration will be the first implementation of the game prioritizing the core gameplay mechanics. This project will be implemented using a free version of GameMaker Studio. The goal is to have a playable level implemented by the end of the semester that features all the core mechanics of the game.
